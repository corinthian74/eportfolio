              <h2>Peer response DP</h2>
              <p>The post rightly points out the challenges encountered by companies in using data science (DS) and the difficulties in planning linked to recent events such as the pandemic or the Ukraine conflict. Whilst Saxena (2021) and Yildrim (2020) further raised concerns around the ongoing requirements for data scientists and the future challenges the role might incur, Dhar (2012) supported the view that DS foremost is "the study of the generalisable extraction of knowledge". Kitchin (2014) raised the concept further and defined DS as a paradigm shift from knowledge-driven decision-making toward a more precise data-driven process. For instance, this evolution can be observed in the recent development of antibiotics through machine learning and away from the typical medical development team (Guardian, 2020). Exscientia's new OCD medication derived through artificial intelligence is also an excellent example of this evolution (Wakefield, 2020). A recent study from Zewe (2022) further points out how machine learning models are used to propose new molecules for drugs, a process which until recently was done by knowledge holders. Albeit these examples are mainly from the pharmaceutical industry, several examples can be observed in other industries such as agriculture, manufacturing or even climate science (Lu et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2018; Jeble et al., 2018). Provost (2013) rightly points out that we must stop seeing data science through the lens of algorithms, techniques, and tools in everyday use but more as a novel approach to problem-solving. This novel approach will make the data scientist more valuable as the complexity of problems keeps increasing.

              <p>
                The post raises serious questions about data science (DS) and ethics, which are of utmost importance. Boyd and Crawford (2012) challenge the concept of DS as the panacea to all problems, raising questions around ethics and the influence of nefast actors. The authors further raise questions about possible data access limitations from governmental institutions or large companies, which cannot be discounted and currently observed in more autocratic countries. In addition, questions to which purpose DS projects are developed and who will be asking the questions data scientists need to answer needs also further inquisition. Leonelli (2016) further posed the question of whether accountability and responsibility are located totally with the project sponsors or with the team working on the DS project, which could have various ramification for the profession.  
               </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Considering the immense growth of data to 97 zettabytes in 2021, with the prospect of doubling further by 2025 (Statista, 2021), it must be remembered that a significant part of this amassment is private human information, which if exploited negatively can have a nefarious effect on the people involved. Further inquiry must also be raised about companies using this data for revenue growth and influence, with only tech-savvy individuals able to limit this impact, leaving large swaths of the population exposed to ethical breaches with no possibility to limit the damage.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Notwithstanding, this vigorous debate has put ethics at the forefront of DS and where academia and governments can make a substantial impact by providing ethical guidelines and best-in-class processes to ultimately make DS a benefit for everybody.

    The observations raised by the post rightly reflect the current evolution of the data scientist and the challenges raised to the role by Saxena (2021) and Yildrim (2020) around the level of skills required and the long-term availability of the role. In addition, recent studies (Gartner 2015a, VentureBeat, 2019) also show little return on investment for companies on big-data projects, which might pose further challenges to the role. In addition, Gartner dropped big data (BD) altogether from its hype-cycle as it did not make it through to a plateau of "Plateau of Productivity" as early as 2015 (Gartner, 2015b). Notwithstanding the negative outlook, remarkable successes can be attributed to the application of data science (DS) in several industries. Pfizer's DS team was pivotal in the development and the speedy delivery of the Covid vaccine across most of the developed world (Waltz, 2021). Marscia (2022) further stated the argument that DS will be pivotal in advancing a new era of medical discoveries. In addition, in the trading environment, DS has helped in automating 92% of forex and more than 80% of equity trading (Shadmehry, 2021). Kuslak (2017) further suggests that manufacturing can still gain significant benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness through the application of DS. Considering that the amount of data generated by 2021 was more than 97 zettabytes and forecasted to double by 2025 (Statista, 2021), the benefits still available through DS are still immense across industries such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and business, making the role of the data scientist ever more relevant.

  <h2>Initial Post </h2>
  <p>
    The emergence of Big Data (BD) has been one of the most critical drivers of data science (DS). BD also provides a foundation for the digital and virtual economy, scientific discovery and social governance (Xu et al., 2021). Within these areas, immense possibilities for innovation are given, such as industrial and management innovation, scientific discovery and the creation of new disciplines. Notwithstanding, transforming BD into economic, social and cultural value poses the most critical challenges, culminating in the data scientist's establishment. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The first attempts to make sense of BD were approached by business intelligence specialists, with their role mainly focused on evaluating data to make sense of the past. In contrast, the data scientist uses data for its predictive value by using new theories, methodologies and advanced technologies (Dietrich, Heller and Yang, 2015). The increased value provided by DS has fueled a growing demand for experts in the field, with more than 900.000 job posting in 2018 in the UK alone (The Royal Society, 2019). Despite the tremendous future outlook, several authors advanced challenges around the role and its future outlook. In a 2019 study, VentureBeat revealed that 87% of data science projects do not become life. Gartner further stated that 80% of data science projects would not deliver business outcomes through most of the 2020s, a statement further confirmed by a NewVantage Partner survey that 77% of companies do not realize value through BD initiatives. In addition, Yildrim (2020) further poses the question of whether future automation might not hinder the growth of data scientists' roles in the future.
